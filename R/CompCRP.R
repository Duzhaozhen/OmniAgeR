#' @title Compute a DNAm-based C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Score
#'
#' @description
#' Computes a DNAm-based surrogate proxy for C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels,
#' a key biomarker for systemic inflammation (inflammaging).
#'
#' @details
#' This function calculates a DNAm-based CRP proxy score from a normalized
#' beta-valued DNAm data matrix. The score is derived by correlating the
#' methylation values with the signs of pre-defined CpG weights from two
#' internal signatures: (i) crp: a vector containing 1765 CpGs and weights
#' associated with CRP as inferred from a large meta-analysis over 20,000 blood
#' samples where both DNAm and CRP was measured, and where no adjustment for
#' variations between memory and naive T-cells was made. (ii) intCRP: contains
#' a 62 CpG CRP-signature that is adjusted for variations between memory and
#' naive T-cells. The resulting output is a relative score that captures the
#' methylation pattern associated with CRP levels.
#'
#' @param betaM A numeric matrix of DNAm beta values (probes as rows). Rows
#' should be Illumina 450k/EPIC CpG identifiers and columns should be samples.
#' @param minCoverage Numeric (0-1). Minimum required probe coverage.
#'   Default is 0.5.
#' @param verbose Logical. Whether to print coverage statistics.
#'
#' @return A \code{list} containing two numeric vectors:
#' \code{CRP} and \code{intCRP}.
