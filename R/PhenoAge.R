#' @title Calculate DNAm PhenoAge
#'
#' @description
#' CCalculates the DNA methylation PhenoAge, an epigenetic biomarker
#' of aging, based on a matrix of DNA methylation beta values. The
#' function implements the model originally developed by Levine et al.
#' (2018), which uses a weighted linear combination of 513 specific
#' CpG sites to predict phenotypic age.
#'
#' @details
#' This function calculates DNAm PhenoAge based on the model by
#' Levine et al. (2018), which predicts phenotypic age by
#' calculating a weighted sum of the beta values from 513 specific CpGs.
#' The function automatically loads the required model coefficients,
#' matches them with the CpGs in the input matrix, and computes the age.
#'
#' @param betaM A matrix of beta values (CpGs in rows, samples in columns).
#' This matrix must be pre-normalized (e.g., via BMIQ) and imputed.
#' @param minCoverage A numeric value (0-1). The minimum proportion of
#'   required CpGs that must be present. Default is 0.5.
#' @param verbose A logical flag. If `TRUE` (default), prints status messages.
#'
#' @return A named numeric vector containing the calculated PhenoAge
#' for each sample.
