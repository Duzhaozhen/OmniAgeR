#' @title Calculate Stochastic Epigenetic Clocks (Tong et al., 2024)
#'
#' @description
#' Calculates DNAm-Age estimates based on one of three stochastic epigenetic
#' clocks (StocH, StocZ, StocP). These are stochastic analogues of the
#' Horvath, Zhang, and Levine/PhenoAge clocks, respectively.
#'
#' They consist of the same CpGs as the original clocks but were trained on
#' artificial cohorts generated via a stochastic process of age-related DNAm
#' change accrual. Although built using sorted monocyte samples from the
#' MESA study, their predictive ability is largely independent of immune
#' cell type or whole blood, as the DNAm data is standardized prior to
#' clock application.
#'
#' The stochastic clocks may serve as a useful complement to the original 
#' clocks, providing a method to assess if specific age-acceleration patterns
#' (or decelerations) could be driven by an underlying stochastic process.
#' This may offer insights into the biological mechanisms of phenotypes
#' linked to epigenetic age acceleration.
#'
#'
#' @param betaM A numeric matrix of beta values. Rows should be CpG probes and 
#' columns should be individual samples.
#' @param minCoverage A numeric value (0-1). The minimum proportion of 
#'   required CpGs that must be present. Default is 0.5.
#' @param verbose A logical flag. If `TRUE` (default), prints status messages.
#'
#' @return A \code{list} containing three numeric vectors: \code{StocH}, 
#'   \code{StocP}, and \code{StocZ}, representing predicted DNAm ages.
